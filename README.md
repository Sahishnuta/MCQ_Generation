## Problem Statement

**Automated Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) Generation from Text Content**

### Core Problem
Manually creating high-quality multiple choice questions (MCQs) is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires significant domain expertise. Educators, content creators, and assessment developers need an efficient way to automatically generate MCQs from textual content while maintaining educational quality and relevance.

### Key Challenges Addressed:
1. **Content Processing**: Extracting meaningful information from various text sources (PDFs, text files, raw text)
2. **Question Generation**: Automatically creating relevant questions that test comprehension of key concepts
3. **Distractor Creation**: Generating plausible but incorrect answer options that are contextually appropriate
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring generated questions are educationally valid and contextually accurate
5. **Scalability**: Handling different document types and content lengths efficiently

### Technical Requirements:
- Process multiple document formats (PDF, TXT)
- Extract key concepts and relationships from text
- Generate questions that test different cognitive levels
- Create meaningful distractors that aren't obviously wrong
- Provide a user-friendly interface for interaction
- Support different educational contexts and subjects

### Target Users:
- **Educators** creating quizzes and assessments
- **Content Developers** building educational materials
- **Corporate Trainers** developing training evaluations
- **Students** generating self-assessment questions
- **Online Learning Platforms** automating content creation

### Success Metrics:
- Relevance and accuracy of generated questions
- Quality and plausibility of distractors
- Processing speed and efficiency
- User satisfaction with the interface
- Adaptability to different subject domains

The solution leverages NLP and machine learning techniques to understand text content and generate educationally valuable assessment items automatically, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual question creation.
